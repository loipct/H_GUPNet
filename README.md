We carefully analyze and study the GUPNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13774) base design; then proposed H_GUPNet, a monocular 3D object detection framework to enhance the object detection performance of the underlying design.

# H_GUPNet

H_GUPNet is a Monocular 3D Object Detection framework based on the GUPNet base design combined with the Homography loss function proposed in (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00754) to enhance the object detection performance of the underlying design. Most current testing is done on single stage detectors that's why we brought this loss function to two stage detector - GUPNet.
